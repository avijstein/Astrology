# Astrology of Astronomers

The project intends to analyze the astrological symbols of famous astronomers.

The data is primarily being drawn from Wikipedia's [list of astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronomers), although not all of these brilliant researchers can be used, since we don't know the birthdates of most 4th Century astronomers.
